        </br>PRIVACY POLICY</br>
        By using the Site, you agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms
        of Use. Please be advised the Site is hosted in the United States. If you access the Site from
        the European Union, Asia, or any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing
        personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in the United States,
        then through your continued use of the Site or Services, you are transferring your data to the
        United States, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in the
        United States. Further, we do not knowingly accept, request, or solicit information from children
        or knowingly market to children. Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy
        Protection Act, if we receive actual knowledge that anyone under the age of 13 has provided personal
        information to us without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that
        information from the Site as quickly as is reasonably practical. This privacy notice applies
        solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following: What personally
        identifiable information is collected from you through the Site, how it is used and with whom
        it may be shared. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data. The security
        procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information. How you can correct any inaccuracies
        in the information. Information Collection, Use, and Sharing We are the sole owners of the information
        collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give
        us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
        We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will
        not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary
        to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you
        via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this
        privacy policy. Your Access to and Control Over Information You may opt out of any future contacts
        from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via our email address
        or phone number:
        <br> See what data we have about you, if any.

        <br> SECURITY
        <br> We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the
        website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive
        information such as passwords, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure
        way. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect
        your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
        example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
        The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure
        environment. If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us
        immediately via telephone or email.

        <br> No information associated with your Google Account is stored or processed by a Fake Company server at any
        point.
